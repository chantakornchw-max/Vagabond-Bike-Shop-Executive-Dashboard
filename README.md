## Project Background
This End-to-End Analytics Project was developed to transform raw transactional data into a high-impact executive dashboard. By integrating SQL-based data processing with Power BI visualization, the project provides a comprehensive view of the company's health over a three-year period (2011–2013).

Vagabond's Bike Shop is a global retail business specializing in high-performance bicycles, components, and accessories. As the business expanded across multiple continents, the need for a centralized, data-driven system to monitor performance became critical for executive decision-making.
